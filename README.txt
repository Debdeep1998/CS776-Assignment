Helloiitk restricts uploading size to 250MB, so I can't remove the features extracted file as it's the most time consuming part of the entire execution.
I'll be removing CIFAR10 dataset folder, and before running the code, please download it from (https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) and extract the RAR file in the same folder.

1."NN_from_Scratch" is the main ipynb file containing solution to all the problems in the assignment.

2.Extracted features  are stored in "aug_train_features.npy" for train and "test_data_features.npy", and has been loaded in the notebook.

3.Trained parameters for both Augmented and Unaugmented dataset are stored in  "Aug_parameters.npy" and "Non_aug_parameters.npy" respectively
and has been loaded in the notebook with appropriate code.

Report can be found in "REPORT_DLCV" pdf.

For any issues regarding execution of the code, please contact me at debdeeppc21@iitk.ac.in
